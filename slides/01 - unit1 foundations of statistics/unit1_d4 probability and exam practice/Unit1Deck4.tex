\frametitle{Probability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Everyday you experience events in which the outcome is uncertain - these are \textbf{random phenomena}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
            There is a 70\% chance of rain today
            \item
            A new cancer treatment is successful for 40\% of patients
            \item
            The probability that I win the lottery is 1 in one million
        \end{itemize}
    \item
    \textbf{Probability} is the way we \emph{quantify} uncertainty or randomness.
    \item
    You have to \emph{interpret} probability in \textbf{your everyday lives}.
    \item
    You have to \emph{interpret} probability in \textbf{statistical analysis}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Probability and Randomness}
The \textbf{probability} of an outcome is the proportion of times that an outcome would occur in a long run of observations, or trials.
    Basic rules of probability are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
         A probability is always a number between 0 and 1.
         \item
         The sum of all of the probabilities for all the possible outcomes equal 1.
    \end{itemize}
\vskip10pt
Sometimes probabilities are reported percents, in which case it should be between 0 and 100\%.

\frametitle{Thought exercise}
By yourself...  here is a number line from zero to one that represents probabilities.  Draw a cutoff point, and label it with a number, such that you classify probabilities as
\begin{itemize}
\item small - an event with this probability would be unusual to happen by random chance
\item not so small - it would not be unusual for an event with this probability happen by random chance
\end{itemize}
\vskip10pt
Below is an example with 0.5 as a cutoff.  Draw \textbf{your} cutoff point where \textbf{you} see fit.\\

\frametitle{Finding probabilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Make \emph{assumptions} about your random process in order to calculate a probability (e.g., each roll of the die is equally likely)
    \item
    \emph{Estimate} a probability with a sample proportion from a \emph{long run} of observations (e.g., collect large amounts of data from which you an estimate a probability)
    \item
    \emph{Estimate} a probability from simulating outcomes

\frametitle{Summary}
Interpreting a probability is important in statistical inference.  Remember the framework for statistical reasoning...
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The data arose from random chance
    \item
    The data didn't arise from random chance - something is really going on here
\end{enumerate}
We assume the chance model is true, and then we determine how likely it is for our observed data to come from the chance model.  When we determine that it is unlikely, or that the probability is `small', we conclude that we have evidence that something is really going on.
