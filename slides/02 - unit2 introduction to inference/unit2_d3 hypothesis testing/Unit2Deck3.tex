\frametitle{Overview}
\textbf{Statistical inference} is drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample from that population.  Two methods of statistical inference are
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{confidence intervals} - estimate a population parameter (with a range of values)
\item \emph{hypothesis testing} - assess evidence for a specific (single) value for a population parameter
\item[]
\end{itemize}
The population parameters we are going to analyze include:
\begin{columns}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    one mean
    \item
    mean of a difference

    \item
    more than two means

A \textbf{hypothesis test} is a method of using data to \textbf{summarize the evidence about a hypothesis}.\\

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{$H_0$ and $H_a$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    We start with a null hypothesis ($H_0$) that represents the status quo.  This is generally a statement of no effect.
    \item
    The research question is represented in the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$).  This is a statement of effect, and it is what we are hoping to show.
    \item
    We conduct the test \underline{assuming the null hypothesis is true}.
    \item
    We then evaluate the test results to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null in favor of the alternative (what we hope to show).
    \item
    Translating a research question into null and alternative hypotheses can be tricky.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Define the parameter of interest}
So far, we are focusing on two types of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    $\mu =$ population mean
    \item
    $p =$ population proportion
\end{itemize}
in the \emph{context} of the research question at hand.\\
\vskip10pt
\begin{columns}
\column{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\underline{Research question:}
Data shows that UCSB students spend \$52 on average for a haircut.  Do Cal Poly students spend the same?
\item
\underline{Parameter:} $\mu=$ population mean amount spent on a haircut by Cal Poly students
\end{itemize}
\column{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\underline{Research question:}
A professor claims that 70\% of Cal Poly students own a Mac laptop.  Can we find evidence for or against this?
\item
\underline{Parameter:} $p=$ population proportion of Cal Poly students that own a Mac laptop
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example research question}
A professor claims that 70\% of Cal Poly students own a Mac laptop.  When we examine our sample data, we see that $\hat{p}=50/67=0.75$, or 75\% of students own a Mac laptop.  Do we have evidence for or against this claim?
\vskip10pt
Two possible explanations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        The population proportion really is different than 0.7
        \item
        The population proportion is actually 0.7, but we observed 0.75 by random chance.
\end{itemize}
\vskip10pt
This is why we do hypothesis testing!

A professor claims that 70\% of Cal Poly students own a Mac laptop.  When we examine our sample data, we see that $\hat{p}=50/67=0.75$, or 75\% of students own a Mac laptop.  Do we have evidence for or against this claim?
\vskip10pt
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    The null hypothesis is one of no effect - that the population proportion of Cal Poly students that own a Mac laptop is 0.7.
    \item[]
    $H_0$: $p=0.7$
    \item
    The alternative hypothesis is one of an effect - that the population proportion of Cal Poly student that own a Mac laptop is different than 0.7.

    $H_a$: $p \neq 0.7$

\vskip15pt
\begin{center}
$\displaystyle \mbox{test statistic} = \frac{\mbox{sample mean}-\mbox{null hypothesis mean}}{\mbox{standard error of the sample mean}}$\\
\vskip10pt
$\displaystyle t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{se_{\bar{x}}}=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
\end{center}
\vskip15pt
This is a \textbf{t test statistic} because the test statistic follows a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{5. The test statistic}
A \textbf{test statistic} describes how far our observed sample statistic falls from the parameter value given in the null hypothesis.  How?
 \textcolor{OrangeRed}{It is the number of standard errors between the observed sample statistic and the parameter value given in the null hypothesis.}\\
\vskip10pt
If the test statistic falls `far' from the value suggested by the null hypothesis, it is evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    We \emph{quantify} the evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative with a $p$-value.  \\
    \item
    The $p$-value is the \textbf{probability} that the test statistic takes the observed value or a value more extreme, \emph{\underline{assuming $H_0$ is true}}.\\
    \item
    Since the $p$-value is always calculated under the assumption that $H_0$ is true, we always interpret this as evidence either supporting or not supporting the null hypothesis.
    \item
    \textbf{The smaller the $p$-value the stronger the evidence against $H_0$.}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=pslide]
\frametitle{6. The $p$-value}
The $p$-value is a \textcolor{OrangeRed}{one-tail} probability from the $t$-distribution because we had a \textcolor{OrangeRed}{one-sided $H_a$}.  This is given by the area under the curve of a $t$ distribution with 49 degrees of freedom \textcolor{OrangeRed}{less} than the value of the test statistic (because $H_a$ was \emph{less} than).

    \textcolor{OrangeRed}{All $p$-values are probabilities.}
    \item
    The smaller the $p$-value the stronger the evidence against $H_0$.
    \item
    A small $p$-value means that the sample data would be unusual if $H_0$ were true.
    \item
    When the $p$-value is `small' you may conclude that there is strong evidence against $H_0$.
    \item
    When the $p$-value is not `small' you may conclude that there is not strong evidence against $H_0$. This implies that the null hypothesis is plausible.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Elements of the $p$-value interpretation}
\begin{itemize}
\item To interpret the $p$-value, apply the definition of the $p$-value to the context of your research question.
\item \emph{Definition:} the $p$-value is the probability that the test statistic takes the observed value or a value more extreme, assuming $H_0$ is true..
\item \emph{Interpretation:}  If the average amount spent on a hair cut by Cal Poly students was truly equal to 52, the probability that we would observe test statistic as extreme or more extreme than -3.39 is 0.0006.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{More ways we can think about the $p$-value}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    If the average amount spent on a hair cut by Cal Poly students was truly equal to 52, the probability that we would observe test statistic as extreme or more extreme than -3.39 is 0.0006. \\
    \item
    If the average amount spent on a hair cut by Cal Poly students was truly equal to 52, the probability that we would observe a sample mean less than or equal to 40 is 0.0006. \\
    \item
    That is, there is about a 0.06\% chance we would observe a test statistic that extreme or more extreme if the null hypothesis were true.\\
    \item If we were to take 10,000 random samples from a population where the average amount spent on a hair cut was truly equal to 52, only 6 out of those 10,000 samples would have results as extreme as the one we observed in our sample.
    \item
    This \textbf{is} substantial evidence \emph{against} $H_0$; therefore, we have evidence in favor of $H_{A}$.

\frametitle{Making a decision}
Based on the $p$-value, make a decision about $H_0$ based on a pre-specified \textbf{level of significance}, also known as $\alpha$.  We always select $\alpha$ \emph{before} looking at the data, and $\alpha$ is commonly set at 0.05.

Elements of a conclusion:

    \item \textbf{Decision about $H_0$:}
    \item[] At the 0.05 level of significance, we reject the null hypotheses that the average amount spent on a haircut is equal to \$52.
    \item \textbf{Statement about the parameter tested in context of the research question:}
    \item[] We do have evidence that the population mean amount of money Cal Poly students spend on a hair cut is less than \$52.
    \item \textbf{Provide a deeper connection of how this relates to the research question:}
    \item[]  Because we have evidence that the population average amount spent on a haircut by Cal Poly students is less than \$52, this means that Cal Poly students tend to spend less than UCSB students, on average.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Going further...}
We found evidence that the population mean amount of money Cal Poly students spend on a hair cut is less than \$52.  How much less?  Is it meaningfully less than \$52?
