## Getting started

### RMarkdown header and getting started chunks

<br>

##### Include this header at the top of all Rmarkdown documents.  
<pre><code>---
title: "Lab X Practice"
author: "Insert names of all present lab members"
date: "Date"
output: html_document
---
</code></pre>

<br>

##### Include this set up chunk after your header to load your libraries.
<pre><code>```{r, include=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
```</code></pre>



## Style

* Change rendered html documents from appearing in a **separate** window to appearing in a **docked** window by clicking on *white gear* to the right of Knit and select `Preview in Viewer Pane`.

* **R code** goes in an *R chunk*.

* **Written responses** are written in the *white space* outside of an R chunk.

* Have **undesired text wrapping**?  Insert a *blank line* in between your written responses and/or code chunks to have items go on separate lines.

* **Style** your written responses using the syntax below to make it easier to read.

* **Customize** the look of your html document by clicking on *white gear* to the right of Knit and selec `Output Options`.  Try different options for `Syntax highlighting` and `Apply theme`.

* Later in in the quarter, you might be intersted in writing with various **math symbols**.  Mathemtatical text renders between *dollars signs*. (Math symbols do **not** go in an R chunk.) Here are some examples:

Math symbol | Rendered result
------------|----------------
`$\mu$`     | $\mu$ 
`$\hat{p}$` | $\hat{p}$
`$\bar{x}$` | $\bar{x}$
`$\neq$`    | $\neq$
`$H_0$`, `$H_a$`      | $H_0$, $H_a$   
`$H_0:\mu=5$`| $H_0:\mu=5$

## Importing 

### Steps to save import code in an R chunk

<br>

1. In the upper right hand corner of RStudio, click on the `Environment` tab.

2. In the `Environment` tab, click on `Import Dataset -> From Text (base)...`.

3. Navigate to where the data set is stored on your computer.

4. Make any necessary changes in the import settings.

5. Click `Import`.

6. In the upper right hand corner of RStudio, click on the `History` tab.

7. Click on the line of code that says `read.csv` - this is the code that was generated to import the data set.  It should turn blue when you click on it.

8. Insert an R chunk into your RMarkdown document.  Place your cursor in the R chunk. 

9. In the upper right hand corner of RStudio, under the `History` tab, click on `To Source`.

10. Verify that the import code is now in your R chunk.  It should look something like this:

<pre><code>```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("LOCATION/mydata.csv", header = TRUE)
```</code></pre>

11. You may need to make minor modifications to this code.  

* If your code says `read_csv`, change this to `read.csv`.  
* If you have an option that says `header = FALSE`, change this to `header = TRUE`.

###### $H_0$: $\mu=value$ \ vs $H_a$: $\mu\neq value$ 

`t.test(x = dataset$variable, mu = value, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")` performs a _one sample t-test_ and computes a confidence interval 

* `value` is a placeholder for the null hypothesis value.
* Make sure to specify `conf.level = "0.__"` as a proportion. For example, to compute a 99% confidence interval type `conf.level = 0.99`.
* `alternative` can also be set to `"less"` or `"greater"`

##### Two sample t-test

###### $H_0$: $\mu_1=\mu_2$ vs $H_a$: $\mu_1\neq \mu_2$

`t.test(dataset$quant_var ~ dataset$categ_var, var.equal = FALSE)` performs a _two sample t-test_ and computes a confidence interval 

`t.test(quant_var ~ categ_var, data = dataset, var.equal = FALSE)` should work equivalently to the code above.  If the top method doesn't work try this one - R may have recently had an update and I experienced difficuly with the top method.

* The `var.equal = FALSE` signifies that we are computing the two-sample t-test under the assumption of _unequal variances_ in the two groups.
* The _default_ settings are `conf.level = 0.95` and `alternative = "two.sided"`.

****

<br>

##### Paired t-test

######  $H_0$: $\mu_d=0$ vs $H_a$: $\mu_d\neq 0$

`dataset$diff_variable <- dataset$quant_var1 - dataset$quant_var2` can be used to create a variable that represents the difference between your paired measurements

`t.test(dataset$diff_variable, mu = 0)` performs a _paired t-test_ and computes a confidence interval 

* `diff_variable` calculates the difference between the two paired variables.
* The `mu = 0` argument signifies that we are testing the null hypothesis that the population mean difference equals zero
* The _default_ settings are `conf.level = 0.95` and `alternative = "two.sided"`.

****

<br>

##### ANOVA

######  $H_0$: $\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3...$ vs $H_a$: at least one $\mu$ differs

* `#yes` is a placeholder for the number of 'successes'
* `#total` is a placeholder for the total number of observations
* `value` is a placeholder for the null hypothesis value, which should be a number between 0 and 1.
* The argument `correct = FALSE` overrides the continuity correction.
* The _default_ settings are `conf.level = 0.95` and `alternative = "two.sided"`

****

<br>

##### Two sample z-test

######  $H_0$: $p_1=p_2$ vs $H_a$: $p_1\neq p_2$

`prop.test(c(x1, x2), c(n1, n2), correct = FALSE)` performs a _two sample z-test_ 

* `x1`, `x2` are the number 'successes' in group 1 and 2, respectively
* `n1`, `n2` are the total number of observations in group 1 and 2, respectively
* The argument `correct = FALSE` overrides the continuity correction.
* The _default_ settings are `conf.level = 0.95` and `alternative = "two.sided"`

****

<br>

##### Chi-squared test

######  $H_0$: there is no association between `var1` and `var2` versus $H_a$: there is an association between `var1` and `var2`

`chisq.test(dataset$var1, dataset$var2, correct=FALSE)` performs a chi-squared test of association 

* `results <- chisq.test(dataset$var1, dataset$var2, correct=FALSE)` saves the chi-squared test results
